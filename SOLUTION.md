# Solution Insights


## Networking, Security, IAM, and Resource Dependencies

<br>

### Networking

**VPC Architecture**: VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones for high availability

**Public Subnets**: Assigned public IP address on ALB to receive traffic from the internet

**Private Subnets**: Assigned rivate IP address on ECS tasks for security, preventing direct internet access

**NAT Gateway**: Allows containers in private subnets to access the internet for updates and dependencies

**Internet Gateway**: Enables inbound/outbound internet access for the public subnets

<br>

### Security

**Security Groups**:

ALB security group allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from the internet

ECS tasks security group only allows traffic from the ALB on the container port

IAM Principle of Least Privilege: Applied through specific roles for ECS tasks

<br>

### IAM 

Task Execution Role: Allows ECS to pull container images and push logs

Task Role: Defines permissions for the running container (currently minimal with commented example for S3 access)

<br>

### Resource Dependencies 

Used implicit and explicit dependencies (depends_on) to ensure proper resource creation order

Used lifecycle configurations to handle updates gracefully (e.g., ignoring desired count changes during deployments)

**Public Exposure**

The service is exposed publicly through an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

ALB is in public subnets and accessible via HTTP on port 80

Security is maintained by placing containers in private subnets

Container access is restricted to only ALB traffic through security group rules

## Reusability, Scalability, and Maintainability

<br>

### Reusability

**Variables**: All configuration parameters are externalized in variables.tf

**Project Naming**: Consistent naming pattern using project_name variable

**Modular Approach**: Logically organized resources by function

<br>

### Scalability

**Auto Scaling**: Implemented step scaling policy based on CPU utilization (scale up at 60%, down at 30%)

**Multi-AZ**: Resources deployed across multiple availability zones

**Fargate**: Serverless container execution eliminates host management concerns

<br>

### Maintainability

**Consistent Tagging**: Applied tags across all resources

**Logging**: Set up CloudWatch logs with retention policy

**Health Checks**: Both ALB and container health checks for robust monitoring

**Outputs**: Provided essential outputs for easy reference

<br>

### Tradeoffs and Considerations

**Cost vs. Reliability**:

- Using two AZs balances cost with reliability

- NAT Gateway adds cost but enables secure outbound connectivity

- Fargate is more expensive than EC2 but reduces operational overhead


**Security vs. Simplicity**:

- Private subnets add complexity but improve security posture

- Security groups implement principle of least privilege

- No HTTPS configured for simplicity (would recommend in production)


**Scalability Settings**:

- Step scaling allows for more aggressive scaling at higher utilization

- Scaling down is more conservative (longer cooldown) to prevent thrashing

<br>

### Improvements for Production

**HTTPS Support**:

- Add ACM certificate and HTTPS listener

- Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection


**Enhanced Monitoring**:

- Add CloudWatch dashboards

- Set up alarms for service metrics

- Implement X-Ray tracing


**CI/CD Integration**:

- Add pipeline configuration for automated deployments

- Implement blue/green deployment strategy


**Network Optimization**:

- Add CloudFront distribution for global edge caching

- Implement WAF for security
